# OpenCV-Computer-Vision-Projects-with-Python
This is the code repository for OpenCV-Computer-Vision-Projects-with-Python, published by Packt. It contains all the necessary code files.
[*] Install OpenCV and related software such as Python, NumPy, SciPy, OpenNI, and SensorKinect - all on Windows, Mac or Ubuntu
[*] Apply “curves” and other color transformations to simulate the look of old photos, movies, or video games
[*] Apply geometric transformations to images, perform image filtering, and convert an image into a cartoon-like image
[*] Recognize hand gestures in real time and perform hand-shape analysis based on the output of a Microsoft Kinect sensor
[*] Reconstruct a 3D real-world scene from 2D camera motion and common camera reprojection techniques
[*] Detect and recognize street signs using a cascade classifier and support vector machines (SVMs)
[*] Identify emotional expressions in human faces using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and SVMs
[*] Strengthen your OpenCV2 skills and learn how to use new OpenCV3 features
